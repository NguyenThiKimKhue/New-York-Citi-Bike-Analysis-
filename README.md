Overview:

The New York Citi Bike Analysis involves designing a series of visualizations to analyze the usage patterns of the New York Citi Bike system. The goal is to uncover insights about ridership trends, user behavior, and station popularity over a specified time period. The visualizations will be compiled into a comprehensive Tableau story for presentation.
Visualizations

1.	Total Trips Recorded
        o	Type: Bar Chart
        o	Description: Display the total number of trips recorded during the chosen period. This visualization will provide a clear overview of the usage of the Citi Bike system.
        o	Analysis: Discuss the overall growth or decline in bike usage, highlighting any significant events or promotions that may have influenced these numbers.
2.	Ridership Growth Percentage
        o	Type: Bar Chart
        o	Description: Show the percentage growth in total ridership over the selected time period. This will help identify trends in bike usage.
        o	Analysis: Analyze factors contributing to ridership growth, such as increased awareness of bike-sharing, urban development, or changes in transportation policies.
3.	Peak Usage Hours in Summer
    o	Description: Visualize the peak hours of bike usage during the summer months.
    o	Analysis: Identify trends in bike usage related to weather, events, or seasonal activities that may influence ridership.
    Peak Usage Hours in Winter
    ss how seasonal factors impact bike usage, including weather conditions and holiday events.
4.	Top 10 Starting Stations
        o	Type: Bar Chart
        o	Description: Display the top 10 (optional) stations for starting journeys today, along with the number of trips from each station.
        o	Analysis: Hypothesize why these stations are popular, considering factors such as proximity to attractions, transit hubs, or residential areas.
5.	Top 10 Starting Ending Stations
        o	Type: Bar Chart
        o	Description: Show the top 10 stations for starting / ending journeys today.
        o	Analysis: 
1.	Explore reasons for high usage at these stations, correlating with nearby amenities or destinations.
2.	Analyze potential reasons for low usage, such as location, accessibility, or lack of nearby attractions.
        Dynamic Map Visualization
        •	Type: Advanced Dynamic Map
        •	Description: Create a dynamic map showing how the popularity of each station changes over time, with zip code data overlaid.
        •	Analysis: Analyze trends in station usage, discussing factors that may influence popularity, such as urban development or changes in local demographics.
        Dashboard Design
        •	Dashboard Components: Combine relevant visualizations into dashboards for each phenomenon. Each dashboard will include:
        o	Key visualizations (e.g., top stations, user type analysis).
        o	Interactive filters to allow users to explore different time periods or user types.
        o	Annotations to highlight significant trends or insights.
        Final Presentation
        •	Tableau Story: Create a cohesive Tableau story that brings together all visualizations, maps, and dashboards. The story will guide viewers through the analysis, highlighting key findings and insights.
        Conclusion
This analysis of the New York Citi Bike system will provide valuable insights into ridership trends, user behavior, and station popularity. By utilizing various visualizations and interactive elements, the final presentation will effectively communicate findings to city officials, supporting informed decision-making for future improvements to the bike-sharing program.
